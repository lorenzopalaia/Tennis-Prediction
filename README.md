## About The Project

This project aims to develop a neural network model capable of predicting the outcomes of tennis matches based on historical player data and match statistics. The model is trained on a dataset of tennis matches, which includes various features such as player performance metrics, match history, and surface type.

The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The provided Jupyter notebooks demonstrate the process of loading the tennis matches dataset, cleaning and transforming the data, handling missing values, and engineering new features to prepare the data for modeling.

2. **Model Development**: The notebooks showcase the development of a binary classification model that predicts the match winner. The model uses the Keras library in TensorFlow and covers model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and training processes.

3. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the trained model is evaluated on a test set, and results such as accuracy and confusion matrix are analyzed to assess the model's reliability in predicting match outcomes.

4. **Deployment and Integration**: The final step would involve deploying the trained model and integrating it into an application that users can interact with, enabling predictions for future tennis matches.

### Built With

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- TensorFlow

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lorenzopalaia/tennis-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd tennis-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The project provides Jupyter notebooks that walk through the data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation steps. You can open these notebooks in a Jupyter environment and follow along with the code and explanations.

```python
# Example code snippet from the notebooks
import pandas as pd

# Load the preprocessed dataset
df = pd.read_csv('matches_final.csv')

# Perform additional analysis or model fine-tuning
# ...
```

For more detailed usage examples and instructions, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/lorenzopalaia/tennis-prediction).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement a web-based interface for the model predictions
- [ ] Explore additional player statistics and features
- [ ] Investigate the use of ensemble models for improved accuracy
- [ ] Expand the dataset to include more tournaments and seasons
